# Pandas Introduction

## Basic Pandas training for most projects

## 1.0 Basic Data Structures in pandas
Series and Dataframes are Pandas' basic data structures and offer a solid structure for most operations with Pandas, NumPy and other libraries

### 1.1 Series
Series is an unidimensional array containing a sequence of values (close to NumPy structure) and an array of labels, called index. 

The file series-basics.py contains the source code used in the training.

In case you conduct any NumPy operation like scalar multiplication or math functions, the index-value relationship will preserve.

One way of thinking of Pandas series is like an ordered dict of fixed size, like a map between values of indexes and values of data. It can be used in many ways a dict could be used.
